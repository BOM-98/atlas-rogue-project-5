# Project Background

## Overview

Atlas Rogue is a fashion rental service specializing in womenâ€™s clothing in Ireland. Catering primarily to women aged 18-34, Atlas Rogue offers a unique approach by exclusively renting out its own collection of fashionable attire.

The service is designed to provide value and convenience to its customers by offering a broad selection of the latest trends and timeless classics, all available for rent. By maintaining a direct relationship with its customers, Atlas Rogue is able to respond quickly to changing fashion trends and customer preferences, ensuring that its collection remains fresh and relevant. The company leverages exceptional SEO and brand awareness strategies to reach a wide audience, making it easy for customers to find and rent the perfect outfit for any occasion without a hefty price tag.

Atlas Rogue simplifies the fashion rental process, offering a seamless online experience from browsing and selection to rental and return. This direct-to-consumer model not only enhances the shopping experience but also fosters a sense of community among its users, who appreciate the brand's commitment to style, quality, and customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement

Atlas Rogue addresses the challenge faced by fashion-conscious women aged 18-34 in Ireland who are seeking a sustainable and cost-effective way to access a diverse and trendy wardrobe. Traditional shopping methods often lead to high expenses, closet clutter, and environmental concerns due to fast fashion consumption. Furthermore, the hassle of navigating multiple rental websites to find quality, fashionable clothing items that suit their tastes and needs adds complexity and frustration to the process.

By offering a curated collection of high-quality women's clothing available for rent through a single, user-friendly platform, Atlas Rogue eliminates the need for consumers to buy fast fashion items that are quickly discarded, thus promoting a more sustainable approach to fashion. This service solves the problem of wardrobe diversity without the associated costs and environmental impact, providing a convenient, cost-effective, and eco-friendly solution for staying fashionable.

## Research:


- User Interviews: 1:1 interviews were conducted with existing online fashion rental shoppers to determine the categories they look for, the designers they like and what the pros and cons are of different competing sites in the country. 
- Competitive Analysis: Examining competing rental stores and websites revealed existing offerings and their strengths and weaknesses. This informed our choice of target market, value proposition, messaging and strategy.

## Design

- I began the process by designing wire-frames of the site in order to get an overall understanding of the user flows and necessary pages to achieve the client outcomes.
- I converted the wire-frames into [a figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/YWbAEWtNoY8F2MQ9Bu6ytS/Atlas-Rogue-Mockups?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=QR0umm1zHzCF4fw5-1) to determine the flow, color schemes and typography that would be used.
- The design was then tested with potential customers to ensure they understood the proposition and were able to navigate the prototype without confusion.
- The logo, typeface and colour scheme were chosen to reflect a gentle and kind brand that was not too serious.

## Agile Development CHANGE

Agile software development methods were used to deliver this project and ensure that an iterative approach was taken to achieve the best results for the end-user. 
- The project was broken down from the high level business outcomes and problem statement into epics and user stories. 
- The end user's requirements were written from the end user's perspective to help make sure the right features were being built in a user-centric way.

A github projects board was used to track and manage the expected workload involved in this project, and break it down into a list of epics, and then further into user stories that could be worked towards to build the site on time.
- Each user story was written with a clear description following the convention of "As a ____, I want to ______, so that ____".
- A T-shirt sizing system was used to estimate the effort involved with each story (S, M, L, XL).
- The end user goal and end business goal was clearly articulated on each story, along with the acceptance criteria. 
- Each story contained the necessary tasks required to complete them and achieve the acceptance criteria. 
- #### [Link to the GitHub Project board](https://github.com/users/BOM-98/projects/5)


User stories were prioritized using the MoSCow method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)
- #### [Link to the MoSCow Prioritization Board](https://github.com/users/BOM-98/projects/5/views/3)

Some user stories relating to ratings and reviews, payment options and customer account management for the website were deemed to not be necessary and therefore were not added to the project. This could be added to the project on a future date.


# Business Model

- Atlas Rogue is an online eCommerce store where customers can rent items of clothing online and have them delivered.
- All clothing items were scraped using the product_scraper.py script from a UK website - [ClOAN STORE](https://www.cloan.uk/).


## Marketing

### SEO

- Keyword research was conducted using [Ubersuggest](https://app.neilpatel.com/en/ubersuggest)
- Given this is a fashion rental site for Ireland keyword research was focused on driving traffic from Irish consumers. Therefore, keyword research was focused heavily on local SEO. 
- Research on UberSuggest showed that the following keywords had significant enough monthly traffic to be worth investing effort to rank for, while having a low enough "SEO Difficulty" i.e. competition to be viable options.
- SEO Difficulty (SD) is on a normalised scale from 1-100, with 100 being the hardest. It is recommended for new websites to aim to target keywords with a SD below 40.
- Long tail keywords that include locations e.g. Cork were added to increase the odds of driving traffic from specific areas in Ireland.
- The top keywords chosen were `dress rental ireland`, `rental dresses ireland` & `rent a dress ireland`.
- These keywords were implemented in the H1 & H2 tags, meta descriptions and titles of pages.
- I attempted not to 'overstuff' keywords in my project and aimed to limit the keywords to max 10 mentions per page.
- I did not have any way to specifically call out `rental dresses dublin` as I did not have inventory I could categorise under than heading. Instead, I attempted to mention Dublin in the about us page and link it to the Homepage twice so that the "link juice" flowed to the homepage and at least give a chance of it ranking on the first page of the keyword term.
- Whenever possible, important keywords were bolded to highlight their importance and increase chances of them ranking. 
- The word `dress` was included in the majority of our product names for dresses, therefore I made sure that the image names matched the name of the item and included the item name in the alt attributes of any image to increase our rankings for the word `dress`.
- A `sitemap.xml` and `robot.txt` file was generated and uploaded to the project to inform Google what pages should be indexed and maximize chances of Atlas Rogue ranking for our targeted keywords.

## Roadmap CHANGE

### Social Media Logins

It is intended to add functionality to allow members register and login using social media authentication from google and meta. This would significantly reduce the friction on sign-up for new members and improve the conversion rate of web visitors to members. 

### Google Calendar Integration

It is intended to add calendar events to the personal calendars of members of the gyms when they book classes. This would help remind members of upcoming classes and has built in functionality to remind members when classes are upcoming. 

### Google Maps Integrations

Tough Glove is moving to a new gym address. Once that address is secured I will be adding a location for the gym to the site. This will help Tough Glove to rank higher on local SEO and inform interested web visitors where the gym is. 

### Implement A Blog 

Tough Glove wants to stand out as a voice of authority in Dublin on the topic of boxing training. Informational blog posts will add an element of credibility to the company and also help Tough Glove rank higher on Google/Bing for targeted keywords. 

### Implement Recurring Classes & Archive Finished Classes

Currently the gym owners are only able to schedule one off classes. I want to add functionality to allow the gym owner to schedule recurring classes that repeat for 28 days from the current date. Classes that have already occurred are still displayed on the admin dashboard and classes page. I want to archive finished classes as they are no longer relevant and should not be taking up space on the site. 

### Alerts If Two Classes Are Made At The Same Time

The gym owner wanted to maintain the ability to schedule two classes at the same time in case two different trainers were taking different classes. However, I intend to add an alert that notifies the admin if this is happening as they are creating the second class to avoid situations were this may still be done unintentionally. I have however added a constraint so that two classes can't have the same date, start time AND end time to demonstrate the capability to restrict on the server side classes made with the exact same information. 

### Password Reset

Currently members can't reset their passwords in case they forget them. I will need to add a password reset option for the admin and members that sends verification emails to their registered email address. 

# Bugs CHANGE

## Bug 1: 



## Bug 2: 



## Bug 3: 



## Bug 4: Django testing was not allowed to create new tables in elephant sql

When running my tests for my program I was getting errors as my test suite did not have permission to create tables in elephant sql. To resolve this issue, I had to change my settings to instruct the program to use the default sqlite3 backend for running the tests.

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}

if 'test' in sys.argv:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        }
    }
```

# Deployment CHANGE

### ElephantSQL Database

> This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:
- Click **Create New Instance**.
- Provide the name of your project e.g. `Tough-Glove`
- Select the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.
- Choose your **Data Center** e.g. `eu-west-1 (Ireland)` 
- Click "Review"
- Once you have checked your details, click "Create Instance"
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.
 - On the details page of your Instance, copy the URL beginning with `postgres://` and Paste your ElephantSQL url in your env.py file
 - Make sure to include your URL in your Heroku app settings as outlined in the Heroku section below

### Cloudinary 

> This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://www.cloudinary.com) to store static files

To set up a Cloudinary API follow these steps:
- Sign up or login to Cloudinary
- Your Cloudinary Dashboard provides access to your API Environment Variable, which you can copy.
- Important: Exclude 'CLOUDINARY_URL=' from the API value, as this represents the key
- Paste your Cloudinary url in your env.py file
- Make sure to include your URL in you Heroku app settings as outlined in the next section



### Heroku

> This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)

To deploy to Heroku I followed these steps: 

- Sign up or login on Heroku
- Create a new app in Heroku by selecting "New" and "Create New App" from the admin dashboard homepage
- Choose your name e.g. `tough-glove` as the name for the project and chose your region e.g. `EU`
- Confirmed creation of a new app
- Navigate to the submenu in the navigation bar and select "resources"
- From here I was redirected to the Deploy tab
- Navigate to Settings and click the "Reveal Config Vars" button
- Create a new Key Value pair with the key of "CLOUDINARY_URL" and the value of the Cloudinary url in the .env file of the app repository
- Create a second Key Value pair with the key of "DATABASE_URL" and the value of the Elephant SQL url in the .env file of the app repository
- Create a third Key Value pair with a value of "SECRET_KEY" and the value of the SECRET_KEY variable in your .env file of the app repository
- Create one more Key Value pair with the value of PORT and a Key of 8000

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `PORT` | 8000 |

- Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
  - requirements.txt
  - Procfile

>You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using:
>
>pip3 install -r requirements.txt
>If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs >updated using:

>pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
>The Procfile can be created with the following command:

>echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile
>replace app_name with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located

- In the Settings tab, ensure that the Python Buildpack is added.
- In the Deploy tab, enable automatic deploys from the Github repository
- Click "Deploy Branch" to deploy the app
- Once the app has been built, click "open app" in the top right corner to test deployment


### Local Deployment

#### Forking the repository

By forking the GitHub Repository you can make a copy of the original repository to view or change without it effecting the original repository.
You can do this by: 
-  Logging into GitHub or create an account. 
- Locate the repository at  [here](https://github.com/BOM-98/tough-glove-project-4)  . 
-  At the top of the repository, on the right side of the page, select "Fork" from the buttons available. 
-  A copy of the repository should now be created in your own repository.

#### Create a clone of this repository

Creating a clone enables you to make a copy of the repository at that point in time - this lets you run a copy of the project locally: This can be done by:

-   Navigate [Here](https://github.com/BOM-98/tough-glove-project-4)
-   click on the arrow on the green code button at the top of the list of files
-   select the clone by https option and copy the URL it provides to the clipboard
-   navigate to your code editor of choice and within the terminal change the directory to the location you want to clone the repository to.
-   type 'git clone' and paste the https link you copied from github
-   press enter and git will clone the repository to your local machine

#### Requirements

For local deployment, you will need to create a .env file in the root directory of the project and set the environment variables in this file.
You will need to define the following variables:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
